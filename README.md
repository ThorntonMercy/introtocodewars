# Intro to Codewars Mini Task

The task is to solve three of the listed four easy Codewars problems. 
The first two are mandatory and the third is our pick from remove string spaces or vowel count. 

These are all easy foundation tasks-
1. Function that determines if a number is even or odd. I provided the ternary operator condensed version and a more basic one like I would've written back in pre-work.
2. Function that converts an integer to a string.
3. I chose the vowel count, so write a function that checks a string for aeiouAEIOU and then adds 1 to the count for each vowel it finds.
